> Step 2: Remotely Connecting
* The following instructions will show how to use VScode/terminal to connect to a remote server over the internet

1. Make sure that Git is installed for Windows. Go to https://gitforwindows.org/ to download. 
2. Follow the steps on the following post to set your default terminal to use git bash in VScode: https://stackoverflow.com/a/50527994
3. Open the terminal (Ctrl or Command + `, or use the Terminal -> New Terminal menu option). You should see the name of your course-specific account and (if this is your first time connecting to this server) you may see
```
â¤‡ ssh cs15lwi23zz@ieng6.ucsd.edu
The authenticity of host 'ieng6.ucsd.edu (128.54.70.227)' can't be established.
RSA key fingerprint is SHA256:ksruYwhnYH+sySHnHAtLUHngrPEyZTDl/1x99wUQcec.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? 
```
4. Type yes and press enter. Then give your course-specific account password. You should see this message after sharing your password and logging in:

```

Your terminal is now officially connected to a computer in the CSE basement. Your computer is called the "client" and the cse basement computer is known as the "server".
